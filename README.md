# Stroke-Prediction-Artificial-Neural-Network-ANN

## Application Purpose    
The objective of the application is to show a sequential model to be trained with various activation neural layers. This model focuses on stroke prediction
in humans with respect to parsing of dataset filled with individual based chararcterstics. This model runs with a prediction **accuracy of 82%**.

## Usage Instructions  
1. Download the zip file for the project or just clone directly
2. Opend command prompt inside the file source on your PC.
3. Run **pip install -r requirements.txt** to install all requirements before running the model
4. Finally run the sequential model using the command **py src/run_model.py**
